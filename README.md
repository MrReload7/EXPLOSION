## Running

To compile and run the program, execute the following command in the terminal:

`mvn clean compile exec:java`

This is a combination of three commands that could each be executed separately if desired:

* `mvn clean` Deletes past compiled output to ensure we start fresh.

* `mvn compile` Compiles the application code.

* `mvn exec:java` Executes the compiled Java application.
